Subject: Request for Absence from Class Next Week

Dear [Teacher's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request permission to be absent from class next week, starting on 27th October, due to [reason for absence, e.g., a family commitment, medical appointment, etc.]. I understand the importance of attending class and assure you that I will make every effort to catch up on any missed work and notes.

Please let me know if there's a convenient time for us to discuss any key topics I might miss or if there are assignments I should prioritize during my absence.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
